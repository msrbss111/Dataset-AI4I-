# Dataset-AI4I-

Note:

1. Binary class refers to implementation of the dataset with labels 0 and 1

2. Multi label class refers to implementation of the dataset with labels 0 - 12 or
Multiple labels

3. Both of these were separated for simplicity and to provide a proper understanding of what is used when since the implementations are quite similar, hence to avoid any confusion it was divided 

4. The word document titled Report consists of the documentation of the steps done

5. In the Binary_class.ipynb and Multi_label_class.ipynb, when there is a column transformation the csv is read again so that any changes in the dataframe will not affect 
the results of the particular implementation done, the time and memory aspect was taken 
into consideration

6. For multi-class, under and over sampling, the training instances are 6045 and testing is 2015 instances since it was difficult to reduce it to exactly 6000 and 2000 instances 
respectively
